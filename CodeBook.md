This study involved 30 participants, all of them identified by the numbers 1-30 in the "Participant" column. 
The Measurements were taken as the participants undertook the following activities, listed as "activities" in the final dataset.

# WALKING 
(value 1): subject was walking during the test.
# WALKING_UPSTAIRS 
(value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test.
# WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
(value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test.
# SITTING 
(value 4): subject was sitting during the test.
# STANDING 
(value 5): subject was standing during the test.
# LAYING 
(value 6): subject was laying down during the test.

The Original Dataset contained the features listed below:
